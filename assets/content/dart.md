# Module 2: Dart Basics

## What is Dart and Why Flutter Uses It
Dart is a modern, object-oriented programming language developed by Google. Flutter uses Dart because it is:
- Easy to learn
- Fast to execute
- Supports asynchronous programming
- Optimized for UI development

### Beginner Explanation
Dart is the language you use to tell Flutter what to show and how to behave.

## Variables in Dart
Variables store information that the app needs to remember or use.

```dart
String userName = "Ahmad";
int progress = 50; 
```

### Why Variables Are Needed

- To store user data
- To track progress
- To store scores, settings, and states

### Real-Life Example
A variable is like a box with a label where you keep something for later use.
### Functions in Dart
Functions help in organizing code. Instead of writing the same code again and again, we put it inside a function and reuse it.

```dart
Dartvoid showMessage() 
{
  print("Welcome to Flutter App");
}
```
### Why Functions Are Important

- Make code reusable
- Improve readability
- Reduce errors

### Control Flow
Control flow decides how and when code executes.

### If-Else Explanation

```dart
Dartif (progress == 100) 
{
  print("Course Completed");
} else 
{
  print("Keep Learning");
}
```
This is similar to real life:
If it is raining → take umbrella
Else → go without umbrella
